# pp-dotfiles

My collection of dotfiles I have gathered over the years and like to use. An install script is included that will backup existing dotfiles and symlink in the home directory to the pp-dotfiles folder.

## installation

- install brew via website

```
brew install alacritty
brew install zoxide
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
